## Installation
If you've played PlugY or any other PD2 single player mod, your current characters/stash will likely be incompatible.
1. Create a copy of your PD2 installation in a new directory.
1. Install [PD2-PlugY](https://github.com/BetweenWalls/PD2-PlugY)
1. Download `pd2data.mpq`
1. Paste this new version of `pd2data.mpq` and overwrite the old `pd2data.mpq` in your PD2-PlugY install.
1. Launch the game with `Plugy.exe`
1. Go to Akara and look for an item with Alkor's quest potion. If it's there, then the mod was installed successfully.
